## Development Notes

### Critical Development Rules

#### NEVER USE MOCK DATA
- **ABSOLUTELY NO MOCK DATA**: This is a production app. Never create, use, or return mock/fake/sample data.
- **Real Data Only**: All data must come from actual sources (HealthKit, Nostr, Cashu mint, etc.)
- **Empty States**: If no real data exists, show proper empty states, not fake data
- **Development Testing**: Use real test accounts and actual workouts, not simulated data
- **Error Handling**: If data sources fail, handle errors gracefully without falling back to mock data

#### NOSTR FRAMEWORK
- **Use nostr-sdk-ios**: We are using the official Nostr SDK for iOS from https://github.com/nostr-sdk/nostr-sdk-ios
- **No Custom Implementations**: Do not implement custom Nostr protocol handling; use the SDK's provided functionality
- **SDK Features**: Leverage the SDK's built-in support for events, relays, keys, and NIPs
- **Stay Updated**: Keep the SDK updated to benefit from latest protocol improvements and bug fixes

### Code Conventions
- SwiftUI view files: PascalCase (e.g., `DashboardView.swift`)
- Service classes: Suffix with "Service" (e.g., `HealthKitService`)
- Models: Clean, Codable structs with clear property names
- Constants: Organized in dedicated Constants file

### Performance Considerations
- Background GPS optimization for battery life
- Efficient HealthKit query batching
- Asynchronous Nostr relay communication  
- Image caching for team/user avatars

### Future Integrations
- Garmin Connect API for additional device support
- Advanced AI coaching features
- Social media sharing capabilities
- Corporate wellness program APIs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **HealthKit Permission Denied**: Ensure physical device testing, check Info.plist
- **Apple Watch Sync Issues**: Verify WatchKit app installation and permissions
- **Cashu Wallet Errors**: Check network connectivity and mint status
- **Nostr Relay Connection**: Test relay accessibility and fallback handling

### Debug Commands
```bash
# View app logs
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'processImagePath contains "RUNSTR"'

# HealthKit debugging
# Enable HealthKit logging in device settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Health

# Network debugging  
# Use Charles Proxy or similar for Nostr relay communication
```

## Bug Fixes & Lessons Learned

### 2025-07-28: Build Compilation Errors

**Issue**: Build failed with Swift compilation errors

**Root Causes & Fixes**:

1. **FitnessTeamEvent Initializer Mismatch** (`Team.swift:86`)
   - **Problem**: Calling `FitnessTeamEvent` initializer with individual parameters (`id`, `content`, `name`, etc.) but the actual initializer only accepts `(eventContent: String, tags: [[String]], createdAt: Date)`
   - **Fix**: Updated call to use correct parameters: `eventContent: description, tags: tags, createdAt: createdAt`
   - **Lesson**: Always check initializer signatures when working with model objects, especially after refactoring

2. **Memory Access Conflict** (`NostrService.swift:416`)
   - **Problem**: Overlapping access to `memberStats[workout.userID]` in single expression: `memberStats[workout.userID]?.lastWorkoutDate = max(memberStats[workout.userID]?.lastWorkoutDate ?? Date.distantPast, workout.startTime)`
   - **Fix**: Extracted to local variable: `let currentLastWorkoutDate = memberStats[workout.userID]?.lastWorkoutDate ?? Date.distantPast`
   - **Lesson**: Avoid multiple accesses to same dictionary key in single expression; use local variables to prevent memory access conflicts

**Prevention Tips**:
- Run frequent builds during development to catch compilation errors early
- Use Xcode's static analysis to identify potential memory access issues
- When refactoring model initializers, search codebase for all usage sites
- Consider using computed properties or methods instead of complex inline expressions
